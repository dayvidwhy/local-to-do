# Local Storage based To-Do List
Just playing around with local storage and how we can keep track of objects using it.

## No jQuery and Bootstrap CSS
I wanted to challenge myself with this part. I'm fairly used to using jQuery for a lot of UI state management and the conveniences it provides. I am definitely starting to appreciate what it offers. I also have not used deeper parts of Bootstraps CSS a lot, so I'm going to see what could be useful on a to do list.

## Goals and Requirements
* No jQuery
* Code be legible
* Use a decent amount of Bootstrap css

## Contributing
Please create a github issue with your suggested change and submit a pull request against it for consideration.

## To-Do
* Better UI management.
* Maybe export list to a calendar service.
