# Local Storage based To-Do List
Just playing around with local storage and how we can keep track of objects using it.

## No jQuery
I wanted to challenge myself with this part. I'm fairly used to using jQuery for a lot of UI state management and the conveniences it provides. I am definitely starting to appreciate what it offers.

## Goals and Requirements
* No jQuery
* Use object methods

## Contributing
Please create a github issue with your suggested change and submit a pull request against it for consideration.

## To-Do
* Better UI management.
* Maybe export list to a calendar service.
